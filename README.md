Data Analysis Nanodegree Project 6  

## Summary  
This data visualization shows monthly-averaged number of flight delay in US.  
The dataset is from 2003 to 2016. You can find the tendency of monthly flight delay.

## Design  
To show monthly-averaged number of flight delay and get the tendency of month, and then we can find that there are a lot of Flight Delay in summer season. And we can get that September has the most on-time flights from the historical performances.  
  
1. The vertical stacked bar graph indicating five type of delay (<http://aspmhelp.faa.gov/index.php/Types_of_Delay>) is designed to show monthly average number of flight delay for all.
The horizontal bar chart improves visualization of the monthly different value.s
I’d like show five type delay shown by different color, so I put a legend for it.  
2. To make a reader understand easily the monthly tendency of flight delay for the airport where he/she is interested in, I put a select box to choice it.  
3. Finally, To make a legend larger and modify labels with removing under bar, we can read it easily. And I add my insights as a title of this visualization.  

## Feedback  
1. A feedback by Reader1 of Design.1 is the following:  
“The color is good to understand type of delay, though I don’t know each detail of type of delay.”  
“It looks the flight delay happens a lot in summer and winter. In Autumn, it’s small number. ”  
“Which airport does this graph consist of? Does Narita indicate same tendency?”  
2. feedback by Reader2 and Reader3 of Design.2 is the following:  
Reader2:  
“The legend looks small.”  
“It’s nice to understand monthly tendency by selecting airport.” (But just only US.. Not support Japan yet..)
Reader3:  
“Honolulu is better in autumn. The carrier delay is the largest number there.”
“July is the worst season for J.F Kennedy.” “It’s very interesting and effective to select the vacation time with a flight.”  
“Anyway, there are a lot of airpots in US…”
